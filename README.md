# DrumCircle

DrumCircle is a mobile app that helps users learn how to read rhythms and/or contribute to a virtual community based learning environment. Letâ€™s say a user knows a rhythm but struggles with the implication of it. Using the search feature the user can press record play/tap a short rhythm and be presented with sheet music examples, based on a library of rhythmic exercises, highlighting the measure(s) in each example where this rhythm was used. They can then choose to hear the example (measure by measure, or full score) while they play along! 
 
Users will also have the option to create/post their own short exercises to the community to be stored, and recommend to other users based on search relevancy and ordered by upvotes from other users.

The app home page will also suggest exercises based on recent searches.

DrumCircle will allow a growing community of percussionists of all levels to accumulate and benefit from a wealth of knowledge and support as they as they journey to learn more about the rhythms that connect us.
